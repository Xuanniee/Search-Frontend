# Search Engine (Frontend)

## Project Description
Search is a frontend clone of Google Search. This project was started so that I could familiarise myself with the basics of HTML, CSS, and SCSS. Hence, the actual implementation of the search was done using Google's own search engine. Throughout the project, I found it daunting to mimic Google's own CSS. This is because Google had appeared to encrypt the exact CSS properties they were using, preventing me from using it as reference.

## Content
Implemented Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
